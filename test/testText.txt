Since the prime factors of 232 âˆ’ 1 are exactly the five known Fermat primes, this number is the largest known odd value n for which a regular n-sided polygon is constructible using compass and straightedge.[3][4] Equivalently, it is the largest known odd number n for which the angle {\displaystyle 2\pi /n} 2\pi /n can be constructed, or for which {\displaystyle \cos(2\pi /n)} \cos(2\pi/n) can be expressed in terms of square roots.

Not only is 4,294,967,295 the largest known odd number of sides of a constructible polygon, but since constructibility is related to factorization, the list of odd numbers n for which an n-sided polygon is constructible begins with the list of factors of 4,294,967,295. If there are no more Fermat primes, then the two lists are identical. Namely (assuming 65537 is the largest Fermat prime), an odd-sided polygon is constructible if and only if it has 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, 771, 1285, 3855, 4369, 13107, 21845, 65535, 65537, 196611, 327685, 983055, 1114129, 3342387, 5570645, 16711935, 16843009, 50529027, 84215045, 252645135, 286331153, 858993459, 1431655765, or 4294967295 sides.[4] If there are more numbers in this list, they must be at least 2233+1 (approximately 102585827973), because every intervening Fermat number is known to be composite.[5]
